codehs_maps
===========

A sample lecture for an AP Java class, on Map. Video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdnIjODR8Ic).

This code includes examples from the lecture, as well as exercises with sample solutions.

Import the project into Eclipse, right click `test/datastructures/MapTest.java` and select "Run As > JUnit Test".
Look at the top of this file for the comment which switches from using exercise starter code to sample solutions.
